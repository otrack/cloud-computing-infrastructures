# A Transactional Banking System

The goal of this practical is to implement a distributed banking application.
Starting from a core of functionalities built around a small set of classes, the system is improved through successive iterations.
First, we consider a centralized Java design and implement a REST interface.
Then, the application is containerized and tested with remote clients.
In a last step, the core is distributed across multiple nodes and we use transactions to maintain data consistency.

## 1. A First Centralized Design

The bank application is built using [Maven](https://maven.apache.org).
Several parts are already provided under `src`.
In particular, the package `eu.tsp.transactions` contains the base definitions of the application.
This includes the `Bank` interface which defines the API of the banking application, and an `Account` class.
Operation `createAccount` allows the creation of a new account.
To retrieve the balance of an account, a client employs `getBalance`.
When executing `performTransfer`, a client transfers some money between two accounts.
A call to `clear` remove all the accounts in the system.
The lifecycle of the banking application is controlled via the operations `open` and `close`.

A centralized implementation of the `Bank` interface is available in the class `eu.tsp.transactions.BaseBank`.
This class is tested with the help of the [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit4) framework in `BaseBankTest` (under `src/test`).
To build a bank object, as in `BaseBankTest.setup`, the application uses a factory pattern.
Let us observe that a bank initially does not contain any account.
Operations `getBalance` and `performTransfer` should thus fail if the account identifiers passed as parameters do not exist.

**[Q11]** Run the tests available under `BaseBankTest`.
Do you think that the functionalities in `BaseBankTest` are properly covered.
If not, you may add a few methods to improve the test coverage.

### 2. REST Interface

The application is intended to be run as a micro-service, accessible via a REST interface.
To this end, the `Server` class makes use of the [Spark](https://github.com/perwendel/spark) framework.
This framework defines several functions (e.g., `put`, `post`) to expose with minimal effort an application to an HTTP client.

**[Q21]** In `Server`, implement a handler for doing a transfer in the banking system.
The handler should accept a `PUT` operation.
The call will be encoded as a path `/from/to/amount`, where `from` is the source account, `to` the destination and `amount` the money transferred between the two accounts.

**[Q22]** Test that your implementation is properly working with the help of the `curl` program.
To run the application locally, you may first package it with maven (`mvn package -DskipTests`).
Then, use the command `java -cp target/transactions-1.0.jar:target/lib/* eu.tsp.transactions.Server` to execute the server.

### 3. Containers and Further Testing

The modern approach to run micro-services is to pack them into containers.
In this practical, we rely on Docker to containerize the application.
We also makes use of Kubernetes (k8s) to execute the container in a remote cluster of machines.
To this end, several files are already available in the provided application skeleton.
A configuration file for Docker (aka., `Dockerfile`) is given under `src/main/docker`
Under `src/main/bin`, the script `run.sh` is in charge of launching the JVM with the `eu.tsp.transactions.Server` as its entry point.
This directory also contains a utility named `image.sh` to create a Docker image of the application, and to push it in `DockerHub`.

**[Q31]** Execute the banking application as a container on your local machine.
As previously, use `curl` to ensure that operations are properly executing.
(In this phase, there is no need to push the image in `DockerHub`, thus you may comment out the last two lines of `image.sh`.)

The next step is to execute and test the banking application in k8s.
Again, to simplify this task, several scripts are available under `src/test/bin`.
The scripts are tweaked with the help of the configuration file `exp.config`.

To parse a pair `key=value` in this file, we use function `config` as defined in `utils_functions.sh`.
Keys have the following meaning:
`local` indicates if the system is deployed in k8s.
`context` is the kubectl context under which the system is run and `image` defines the Docker image to use.
Key `pull-image` defines the policy to use when fetching the image from a remote repository (here, DockerHub).
The number of system nodes is set with key `nnodes`.
The `exp.config` file also mentions a number of Google storage related parameters (`bucket`, `bucket_key` and `bucket_secret`).
They are detailed later.

A client test suite is available under `src/test/bin`.
This small benchmark executes the storage service in k8s using a load balancer to expose the service.
`test.sh`, is the client frontend of the test suite.
It uses `banking_functions.sh` and `utils_functions.sh` to deploy the system and to execute a given workload.
The former script defines banking operations, while the later contains a set of utilities for k8s.
The directory `templates` contains the k8s templates of the banking system (both the system and the load balancer).

**[Q32]** Create a cluster in Google Cloud Platform to host the containers.
(As we will scale-out the system later on, it is advised to already provision a few nodes.)
Import the credentials of the cluster, and create an appropriate context with the `kubectl` command.
This last sequence of steps is recalled below:

	GCP_PROJECT=$(gcloud config list --format='value(core.project)')  
	ZONE_NAME="europe-west3-a"
	CLUSTER_NAME="cloud-computing-course"
    gcloud container clusters get-credentials ${CLUSTER_NAME} --zone ${ZONE_NAME}  
    kubectl config set-context ${CLUSTER_NAME}  --cluster=gke_${GCP_PROJECT}_${ZONE_NAME}_${CLUSTER_NAME} --user=gke_${GCP_PROJECT}_${ZONE_NAME}_${CLUSTER_NAME}  

**[Q34]** Export the Docker image in DockerHub.
Test your application using the test suite available under `src/test/bin`.

### 4. Distributing the Application

In this final step, we implement the `DistributedBanking` class and distribute the system across multiple nodes.
To achieve this, we replace the `account` variable in `BaseBanking` with a distributed mapping.
The mapping is implemented with [Infinispan](https://infinispan.org) (ISPN), a NoSQL transactional distributed storage from Red Hat.

**[Q41]** To have an overview of ISPN, read the introduction (Section 1) of the  [documentation](https://infinispan.org/docs/9.4.x/user_guide/user_guide.html).
Browse through the [online](https://infinispan.org/tutorials/simple/simple_tutorials.html) tutorials.
In particular, we advice you to have a peek at [this](https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan-simple-tutorials/blob/main/infinispan-embedded/cache-distributed/src/main/java/org/infinispan/tutorial/simple/distributed/InfinispanDistributed.java) tutorial.
At the light of the CAP impossibility result, where does this system stands?

A `Cache` in Infinispan implements a `ConcurrentMap` object as specified in the `java.util.concurrent` package.
Several operational modes are possible for the cache, synchronous, asynchronous, with or without transactions.
Depending on the configuration parameters, a cache can be local to a Java application, or spread across several nodes.

As a starter, we use a distributed asynchronous cache which runs in the same memory space as the application (embedded mode). 
This means that the `ConfigurationBuilder` to deploy the cache is written as follows

    ConfigurationBuilder builder = new ConfigurationBuilder();
    builder.clustering().cacheMode(CacheMode.DIST_SYNC);

Infinispan relies on the JGroups library to communicate.
When running locally, we use the default TCP-based configuration on JGroups (available under `src/main/resources/default-jgroups-tcp.xml`).
In this configuration, JGroups relies on IP multicast to implement nodes discovery.
This communication primitive is generally disabled at cloud service providers (like GCP).
Consequently, we will use a data bucket in GCP for this task (further details are available [here](http://www.jgroups.org/manual/html/protlist.html#d0e5404)).

**[Q42]** In GCP, create a bucket in the [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage) menu.
Notice that bucket names are global, and as a consequence you will have to use a unique name to avoid collisions. 
Under `Settings`, make your bucket backward compatible and pick a pair `(key,secret)`.
Update the file `exp.config` appropriately.

Upon deploying the banking application in a container, `run.sh` picks the right JGroups configuraion with the help of the IP address of the container.
The chosen file is renamed as `jgroups.xml` 
Hence, to assign a JGroups configuration in `DistributedBank`, you may use the following code:

    GlobalConfigurationBuilder gbuilder = GlobalConfigurationBuilder.defaultClusteredBuilder();
    gbuilder.transport().addProperty("configurationFile", "jgroups.xml");
	
**[Q43]** Create a variable `accounts` in `DistributedBank` backed by an Infinispan cache.
Implement the `Bank` interface using `put` and `get` operations, as in `BaseBank`.
Deploy the application over multiple nodes in GCP (e.g., 3).
Test the application with the scripts `test.sh` and the flag `concurrent-run`.
If you set a small number of bank accounts, what do you observe when concurrent operations take place?
What is the name of this anomaly?

**[Q44]** To fix the above problem, we use the transaction support provided by Infinispan.
Change the cache object to be transactional.
This can be done programmatically as follows:

    builder.transaction().transactionMode(TransactionMode.TRANSACTIONAL).lockingMode(LockingMode.PESSIMISTIC);
	
Modify `performTransfer` to execute a transaction and check that your code is fully functional.

**[OPT]** To make the system usable, it would be necessary to add data persistence.
Another interesting option is to replicate accounts across several nodes to improve system availability.
